This is a freelance Front-End web development project for an Auckland based driving school startup called Brilliant Driving Academy (brilliantdrivingacademy.co.nz). I designed, developed, and deployed the project myself from scratch. I utilised React JS for the development, Git version control for the Continuous Integration, GitHub Actions for the Continuous Deployment, Firebase for hosting the project, GoDaddy for obtaining the domain name, and Google Search Console for the Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).
